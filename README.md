# a-game-of-pick-and-choose
This game was made using react app. First of all i designed the look and feel of the app.
then I used the for loop to pass 10 die values and used the math.random function to generate random numbers from 1-6 of the values.
The roll button on the app makes sure that random numbers etween 1-6 are generated as it is clicked

i created different functions that enbaled the dice when clicked to be held, highlighting their colours to show that they were held, so
when a player rolls again, more numers are generated for the unheld dice, while the held ones are in place.

once all the numers of the same value are held the game is finished. i also added a timer that calculates the exact time it takes 
a user to finish each game. then added a play button to start the game

HOW THE GAME WORKS;
Roll until all dice are the same. Click each  dice to freeze it at its current value between rolls
